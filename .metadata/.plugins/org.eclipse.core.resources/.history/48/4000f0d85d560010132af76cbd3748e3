// Manager class is interface having all methods as abstract and due to interface we can not add any concrete method in Manager class.
// Due to absence of concrete method in Manager, TL can't extends Manager but implements that interface Manager.	
// There is no role to right abstract method compulsory if class is abstract but in opposite if class having abstract mehtod so we will have to make class as abstract.
